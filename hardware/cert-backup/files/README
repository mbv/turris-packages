cert-backup
===========

A script that stores the given certificate onto a backup partition for the case
of full restart (eg. data wipe).

Call with list of files to store or remove. Each file to remove must be
preceded by -r.

For example, to add files /etc/a and /etc/b and remove /etc/c and /etc/d, you'd
call it as:

  ./cert-backup /etc/a /etc/b -r /etc/c -r /etc/d

In addition to -r, a file name may be prefixed with -x. In such case, the file
is extracted from the backup, not stored. As with -r, -x modifies behaviour for
only the single following file.
